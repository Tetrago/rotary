# Vulkan Toolkit

```cpp
#include <vtk/vtk.hpp>
```

## Purpose

The Vulkan Toolkit library is reponsible for modernizing and bootstrapping the Vulkan library to make its implementation within Rotary simpler and more organized.
This is achieved primarily using builders to reduce the complexity of constructing Vulkan objects.

The majority of the provided Vulkan wrappers can be casted to there underlying types.
