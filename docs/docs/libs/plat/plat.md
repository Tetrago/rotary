# Platform Toolkit

## Purpose

The purpose of the Platform Toolkit library is to provide an abstraction for all platform-based tasks,
such as window handling, dialog prompts, and any cross-platform necessities not provided by the STL, as
well as some additional STL abstraction if necessary (such as the filesystem module).

## Modules

- [Window](plat/window)
- [Vulkan](plat/vulkan)
- [Filesystem](plat/filesystem)
